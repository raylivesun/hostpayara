             <h1>1.1 Integers and Rational Numbers</h1>
             <p>Integers and rational numbers are important in daily life. The price per square yard of carpet is a rational number.
The number of frogs in a pond is expressed using an integer. The organization of real numbers can be drawn as a
hierarchy. Look at the hierarchy below.</p>

            <p>The most generic number is the real number; it can be a combination of negative, positive, decimal, fraction, or
                non-repeating decimal values. Real numbers have two major categories: rational numbers and irrational numbers.</p>
                <p>
                <b>Definition:</b>
                √ Irrational numbers are numbers that can be written as non-repeating, non-terminating decimals such
                as π or 2.</p>
                <p>
                <b>Definition:</b> Rational numbers are numbers that can be written in the form ab , where a and b are integers and b 6= 0.
                All Irrational Numbers and Rational Numbers are Real Numbers</p>
                <p>
                <b>Definition:</b> Integers are all the whole numbers, zero and the negatives of the whole numbers. i.e. {. . . -5, -4, -3, -2,
                -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. . . } All Integers are Rational Numbers.</p>
                <p>
                <b>Definition:</b> Whole Numbers are all Counting Numbers and the number zero. i.e. {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. . . } All Whole
                Numbers are Integer.</p>
                <p>
                <b>Definition:</b> Counting Numbers are the the natural numbers from 1 to infinity. i.e. {1, 2, 3, 4, 5. . . } All Counting
                Numbers are Whole Numbers.</p>

            <h2 style="color: orangered">A Review of Fractions</h2>
            <p>You can think of a rational number as a fraction of a 
cake. If you cut the cake into b slices, your share is a of those
                slices. For example, when we see the rational number 21 ,
 we imagine cutting the cake into two parts. Our share is
                one of those parts. Visually, the rational number 12 
looks like this.</p>

            <p>There are two main types of fractions:</p>
            <p>• Proper fractions are rational numbers where the numerator is less than the denominator. A proper fraction
                represents a number less than one. With a proper fraction you always end up with less than a whole cake!</p>
                <p>
                • Improper fractions are rational numbers where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.
                Improper fractions can be rewritten as a mixed number – an integer plus a proper fraction. An improper
                fraction represents a number greater than or equal to one.</p>
                <p>
                When evaluating fractions, it is possible for two 
fractions to give the same numerical value. These fractions are
                called equivalent fractions. For example, look at a 
visual representation of the rational number 24 .</p>
